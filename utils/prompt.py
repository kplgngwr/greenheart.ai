1. **Disease Identification**: Analyze the provided image and sensor data to detect any diseases, pests, or deficiencies.
2. **Detailed Findings**: Provide in-depth findings on the identified issues, including possible causes and severity.
3. **Recommended Actions**: Suggest effective treatment options, preventive measures, and further actions.
4. **Preventive Measures**: Offer recommendations to prevent recurrence.
5. **Expert Recommendations**: Provide long-term health and disease management strategies.
